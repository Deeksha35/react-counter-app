# React Counter App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
## What It Does

- Shows a number on the screen.
- You can click **"+"** or **"â€“"** buttons to change the count.
- Or use your keyboard:
  - Press **Arrow Up** to increase.
  - Press **Arrow Down** to decrease.
  - Press **R** to reset the count.
- The count stays between 0 and 10 so it doesnâ€™t go wild.
- Itâ€™s styled with some basic CSS to keeps it clean and simple.

## Why I Made This

As an engineering student learning React, I wanted to build something interactive to really understand how Reactâ€™s state and event handling works. This project helped me get comfortable with React hooks and making my UI respond smoothly.

## How to Try It Out

1. Clone the repo to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deeksha35/react-counter-app.git
2. cd react-counter-app
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 â€” enjoy!


## Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m planning to add some cool animations, let users set their own min and max numbers, and maybe even add some tests to make sure everything works perfectly.
